    <h2>The Formats</h2>

    <p>There are three formats provided in this library:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>PDF</dt>
      <dd>PDF is an ISO standard. Most modern devices have a PDF reader available. PDFs in this
      library are produced using either LaTeX or PrinceXML. LaTeX derived PDFs are the highest
      quality format available, and are provided in A5 size (suitable for printing and iPad sized
      devices) and a smaller "e-reader" size specialised for Kindle type devices. PrinceXML derived PDFs are
      lower quality (but easier to produce) and are only provided in the smaller size; these will be
      replaced by LaTeX PDFs as time allows. Do not use PDFs if you want the ability to change font
      size on the fly, and, for best results, make sure you choose the correct size.</dd>

      <dt>EPUB</dt>
      <dd>EPUB is an IDPF standard. Many devices have EPUB readers available. It is reflowable, so
      it is possible to change font size and other display parameters on the fly. However, the
      quality of reading experience is determined by the quality of the EPUB software on your
      particular device, and this can be quite variable. In particular, devices tend not to
      implement hyphenation, leading to erratic spacing of words on smaller screens.</dd>

      <dt>MOBI</dt>
      <dd>MOBI is a proprietary format used by Amazon's Kindle. It has the same advantages and
      disadvantages as EPUB, with the added disadvantage that it is only usable on Amazon's devices
      or with Amazon's readers.</dd>
